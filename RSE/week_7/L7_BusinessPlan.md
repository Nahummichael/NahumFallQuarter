NOMAD BKG (name still in progress)

exectutive summary: 
what im doing is making a basketball team that plays everyone, from offical teams to a group of friends that simply want to play for fun.
key goals would be to challenge people to help them improve their basketball skills, while simultaneously having as much fun as possible

Company Description:
Mission statement: We play for fun, but we take it seriously
im selling basketball challenges, meaning im making a team that people can challenge for fun, entertainment, or practice
The primary business location would likely be near a school thats heavily sports/basketball related

Market Analysis:
my ideal customer would be the people who are highly proud of their basketball skills, or coaches who want to test their players

Competitor Analysis:
my business's strengths are that its a rather original idea (at least to my knowledge), and depending on the people who make use of it, my business could blow up.
A major weakness is that people could view it as useless as if I cant find that price range that people are okay with but still get me a comfortable amount of money and over price it then it wont get any traction.

Marketing Plan:
to start sales I could have games that people could watch for free and let them use it as reference to improve themselves or simply enjoy watching the videos but then leave the really intense and actually interesting games behind a pay wall or at least make it so they have to give us a recommendation of which team/people we should face off. (use ai to make sure they are propsing valid teams to challenge)

Management Team:
the management team would consist of me and my friends that i trust with managing my company's money

Financial Plan:
on start up im likely working with a couple thousand dollars (depending on when I try starting the business, thanks to my parents) and depending on if i can get atraction or movement for my people.
